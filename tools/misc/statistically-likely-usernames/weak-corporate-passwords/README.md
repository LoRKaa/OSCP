# The minimal most likely passwords for corporate environments
This resource contains passwords which meet typical corporate password policies, but are so predictable that there would likely be at least one user with this password in every corporate environment.
The basic lists are the most likely passwords (obviously).

Use "Password1" by default, as this pretty much kills it every time.

For dates, it is best to select the current season, current month, and previous season and month (possibly also next month and season, and special holidays).
For example, in January 2017, it would probably be best to choose one of the following:

January2017
Winter2017
December2016
Autumn2016
Feburary2017
Spring2017
Christmas2016
